# Summary
.NET Transactional File Manager is a .NET API that supports including file system operations such
as file copy, move, delete, append, etc. in a transaction. It's an implementation of
System.Transaction.IEnlistmentNotification.

This project was originally on [CodePlex](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=transactionalfilemgr) and
was migrated to GitHub using [fast-export](https://github.com/frej/fast-export) by Frej Drejhammar.

This library allows you to wrap file system operations in transactions like this:

```
// Wrap a file copy and a database insert in the same transaction
TxFileManager fileMgr = new TxFileManager();
using (TransactionScope scope1 = new TransactionScope())
{
    // Copy a file
    fileMgr.Copy(srcFileName, destFileName);

    // Insert a database record
    dbMgr.ExecuteNonQuery(insertSql);

    scope1.Complete();
} 
```

# Current features

# Frequently Ased Questions
## How do I run tests?

In a PowerShell/Command window:
* cd <path to ChinhDo.Transactions.FileManagerTest> folder
* dotnet test

In Visual Studio, open Test/Text Explorer and choose Run All Tests (or CTRL-R, A)

## Can I reuse instances of TxFileManager?

It's not expensive to create new instances of TxFileManager as eeded. There's a bit of overhead (like
creating instances of any small class) but not much.

On the other hand, you can also re-use the same instance for multiple transactions, even nested
transactions.

## Is TxFileManager Thread Safe?

Yes - it's been tested for that.

## Which IsolationLevel's are supported?

Regardless of the specified IsolationLevel, the effective IsolationLevel is ReadUncommitted.

## What does the release roadmap look like?

I am working on version 1.4 with a few bug fixes and enhancements. See the Issues list.
