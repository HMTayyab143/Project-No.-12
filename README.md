# Summary
.NET Transactional File Manager is a .NET API that supports including file system operations such as file copy, move, delete, append, etc. in a transaction. It's an implementation of System.Transaction.IEnlistmentNotification (works with System.Transactions.TransactionScope).

This project was originally on [CodePlex](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=transactionalfilemgr) and was migrated to GitHub using [fast-export](https://github.com/frej/fast-export) by Frej Drejhammar.

This library allows you to wrap file system operations in transactions like this:

```
// Wrap a file copy and a database insert in the same transaction
TxFileManager fileMgr = new TxFileManager();
using (TransactionScope scope1 = new TransactionScope())
{
    // Copy a file
    fileMgr.Copy(srcFileName, destFileName);

    // Insert a database record
    dbMgr.ExecuteNonQuery(insertSql);

    scope1.Complete();
} 
```
