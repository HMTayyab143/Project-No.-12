Transactional File Manager is a .NET Standard 2.0 library that supports including file system operations such
as file copy, move, delete, append, etc. in a transaction. It's an implementation of
System.Transaction.IEnlistmentNotification.

This library allows you to wrap file system operations in transactions like this:

``` csharp
// Wrap a file copy and a database insert in the same transaction
IFileManager fm = new TxFileManager();
using (TransactionScope scope1 = new TransactionScope())
{
    // Copy a file
    fm.Copy(srcFileName, destFileName);

    // Insert a database record
    db.ExecuteNonQuery(insertSql);

    scope1.Complete();
} 
```

# Current features

Support the following file operations in transactions:
* AppendAllText: Appends the specified string the file, creating the file if it doesn't already exist.
* Copy: Copy a file to another file.
* Delete: Delete a file.
* Move: Move a file.
* CreateDirectory: Create a directory.
* DeleteDirectory: Delete a directory.
* MoveDirectory: Move a directory.
* Snapshot: Take a snapshot of the specified file. The snapshot is used to rollback the file later if needed.
* WriteAllBytes: Write the specified bytes to the file.
* WriteAllText: Write the specified text content to the file.

This library is available as a [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TxFileManager) package. The current/latest release is 1.4.

# Quick Start

1. Add a reference to TxFileManager

```
dotnet add package TxFileManager
```

2. Start writing code

``` csharp
IFileManager fm = new TxFileManager();
using (TransactionScope scope1 = new TransactionScope())
{
    // Copy a file
    fm.Copy(srcFileName, destFileName);

    scope1.Complete();
} 
```

# Frequently Asked Questions
## How do I run tests?

## How do I reference this library?

The recommended method is to add a NuGet reference:

```
dotnet add package TxFileManager
```

Or Use Visual Studio's Manage NuGet Packages to add. Search for "TxFileManager".

## Can I reuse instances of TxFileManager?

It's not expensive to create new instances of TxFileManager as needed. There's a bit of overhead (like creating instances of any small class) but not much.

On the other hand, it's totally safe to re-use the same instance for multiple transactions, even nested transactions.

## Is TxFileManager Thread Safe?

Yes - it's been tested for that.

## Which IsolationLevel's are supported?

Regardless of the specified IsolationLevel, the effective IsolationLevel is ReadUncommitted.

## How does TxFileManager work?

See Chinh's blog post: [Include File Operations in Your Transactions Today with IEnlistmentNotification](https://www.chinhdo.com/20080825/transactional-file-manager/)

## Where are temporary files/directories kept?

By default, the path returned by Path.GetTempPath() is used to keep temporary files/directories used by TxFileManager. However, you can override that and have TxFileManager use another temp path:

```csharp
IFileManager fm = new TxFileManager(myTempPath);
```

## How do I contribute to the project?

* Fork the repo
* Create a branch such as my-new-feature
* Make your change/fix and associated unit tests and commit
* Run the tests (```dotnet test```)
* Open a Pull Request (PR) to the "master" branch

Notes: A release branch will be created out of the master branch when a release is made. The master branch will contain the latest features being added/tested for the next release.
